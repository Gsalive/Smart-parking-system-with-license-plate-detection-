# vehicle-number-plate-recognition
This project explains the design of Arduino based smart car parking system. Authorization
of car number plate in the database is the basic rule used to park a vehicle in a parking place.
Authorization database will be given to each user, which carries the vehicle number or other
details. If the faculty/student is authorized and space is available in the parking area, then the
parking gate opens, and the user is allowed to park the vehicle in parking place according to
their category and availability of parking slots else the user is not allowed to enter the parking
even if the user is authorized .It manages the time, also provides security to a vehicle and an unauthorized 
user is not allowed to enter into a parking place whereas they are given separate parking slots. It helps to park
vehicle in empty slot parking also as it will display which slot has free space.
